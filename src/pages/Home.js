      <h1>About this application:</h1>
      <text>
        This is a study app I made out of react, where you can create decks, and add flashcards with a<br />
        front and back to those decks. Once you have the desired cards, you can study by matching the <br />
        cards, short answer, or multiple choice. This was inspired when I was using anki to study Japanese<br />
        for almost half a year. Anki did not have my desired study methods, and so I decided to implement   <br />
        them myself through this app.
